### About me

I am passionated in programming stuffs. With each passing day, new stuffs are developed and can be applied to our daily life. In recent decades, computer and smartphone are some obvious example. With the existence of new devices, there are always firmware / software to control the deveice and provide services to the user. By learning and utilising programming skills, I can code a tailor-made program to automate my tasks and make my life easier. It is such a great skill set to our life.

Hopes that the knowledges learnt in HKUST can be the cornerstone of my future development.
